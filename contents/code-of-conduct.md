###The LUCSSA Community Code of Conduct

All members, committers and volunteers in this community are required to act according to the following code of conduct. We encourage you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep LUCSSA a positive, growing community and help us provide and ensure a safe environment for everyone.

###RESPONSIBLE AND ENFORCING THIS CODE OF CONDUCT

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us immediately: contact Ben Tranter ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xBen) | [Email](mailto:bwtrante@lakeheadu.ca)) or Cody Antcliffe ([Email](mailto:caantcli@lakeheadu.ca)). We are there to help you. Your reports will be taken seriously and not dismissed or argued with.

###WHAT WE BELIEVE IN AND HOW WE ACT

LUCSSA's main goal is to empower people and enable them to succeed in Computer Science at Lakehead University, and in the greater field of Software Development. Thus, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of sex, gender, sexual orientation, personal ability or disability, ethnicity, religion, level of experience, set of skills or similar personal characteristic.

Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement. We believe that a diverse community where people treat each other with respect is stronger, more vibrant and has more potential contributors and more sources for ideas. We aim for more diversity.

- We are kind, welcoming and courteous to everyone.

- We’re respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments and their efforts.

- We’re attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.

- We are aware that language shapes reality. Thus, we use inclusive, gender-neutral language in the documents we provide and when we talk to people. When referring to a group of people, we aim to use gender-neutral terms like “team”, “folks”, “everyone”. (For details, we recommend [this post][1]).

- We respect that people have differences of opinion and criticize constructively.

###DON’TS

- Don’t be mean or rude.
- Don’t discriminate against anyone. Although we have phrased the formal diversity statement generically to make it all-inclusive, we recognize that there are specific attributes that are used to discriminate against people. In alphabetical order, some of these attributes include (but are not limited to): age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, national origin, physical or mental difference, politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and subculture. We welcome people regardless of the values of these or other attributes.
- Sexism and racism of any kind (including sexist and racist “jokes”), demeaning or insulting behaviour and harassment are seen as direct violations to this code of conduct. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
- On GitHub, this website, Slack, IRC, and other online or offline communication channels, don't use overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
- Unwelcome / non-consensual sexual advances over Slack, IRC, or any other channels related with this community are not okay.
- Derailing, tone arguments and otherwise playing on people’s desires to be nice are not welcome, especially in discussions about violations to this code of conduct.
- Please avoid unstructured critique.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.
- Sponsors of LUCSSA are also subject to this code of conduct. In particular, sponsors are required to not use sexualized images, activities, or other material which is not according to this code of conduct.

###CONSEQUENCES FOR VIOLATIONS TO THIS CODE OF CONDUCT

If a participant engages in any behaviour violating this code of conduct, the core members of this community may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community, exclusion from any interaction and loss of all rights in this community.

###DECISIONS ABOUT CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATIONS

Decisions about consequences of violations of this code of conduct are being made by this community’s core members as named above and will not be discussed with the person responsible for the violation.

###FOR QUESTIONS OR FEEDBACK

If you have any questions or feedback on this code of conduct, we’re happy to hear from you.
